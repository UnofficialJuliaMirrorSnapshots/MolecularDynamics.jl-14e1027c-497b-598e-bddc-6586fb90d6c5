Example program that calculates the radial distribution function using some of
the available features in Julia for parallel computing. You can use the example
.xtc and .ndx files in the rdf folder for use with this as well. By
default the program creates a radial distribution function of the methane carbon
and the water oxygen. The output is stored to "rdf.dat" and a graph is created
and saved to "plot.svg". PyPlot and ArgParser are required for this program.
