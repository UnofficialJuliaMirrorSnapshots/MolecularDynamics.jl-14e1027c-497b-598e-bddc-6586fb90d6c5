Example program that calculates the radial distribution function. The example
xtc file and ndx file correspond to a simulation of one methane in water. By
default the program creates a radial distribution function of the methane carbon
and the water oxygen. The output is stored to "rdf.dat" and a graph is created
and saved to "plot.svg". PyPlot and ArgParser are required for this program.
