#=	gmxType is what is returned at the end of running "read_gmx"
	The variable "gmx" of gmxType is defined in "read_gmx" 
	and all the arrays are initialized there.

	no_frames	-	number of frames that were read in
                    note that time zero starts at frame 1 !!	
	time		-   the time at the current frame
					accessed by "gmx.time[frame]"
	box			-	the box of the current frame with dimensions 3 x 3
					accessed by "gmx.box[frame]"
	x			-   the cartesian coordinates of the atoms which were read in
					accessed by "gmx.x["Group"][frame][:,atom]"
					"Group" is the name of the index group from the index file, or
					it is "all" if no index file was specified.
	natoms		-   the number of atoms in each group
					accessed by "gmx.natoms["Group"]
